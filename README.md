# -轨迹预测论文解析
本仓库旨在解析目前轨迹预测领域的顶会和顶刊，透过文章看代码来理解高水平论文之间的潜在联系。有时候，一篇顶刊或者顶会只是思路很清奇，然而工程量并没有多复杂，让我们对顶刊顶会去魅的同时一起学习作者的思路和对baseline的改进过程。
# - Analysis of Trajectory Prediction Papers
This repository aims to analyze the top conferences and journals in the field of trajectory prediction. By examining the code behind the articles, we seek to understand the potential connections between high-quality papers. Sometimes, a top journal or conference paper may only feature an ingenious idea, with no overly complex engineering work involved. While demystifying these top journals and conferences, we can also learn from the authors' ideas and the process of improving baselines.
